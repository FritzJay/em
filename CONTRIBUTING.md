# Contributing Guidelines

## Functional Programming

Adhere to the functional programming style, namely no mutations. The linter will enforce this.

- No `let`; use `const`
- No `for` loops; use `map`, `filter`, `reduce`

See existing code if you are unfamiliar with this approach. Support will be offered to those new to this style, but a willingness and effort is required. Do not claim an issue or submit a PR if you are unable or unwilling to adhere to this requirement.

## PR Acceptance

PR's that solve the given issue but introduce a regression (that is, break something else in the process) are not considered solutions and will not be accepted.

## Code of Conduct

Please note that this project is released with a [Contributor Code of Conduct](https://github.com/cybersemics/em/blob/dev/CODE-OF-CONDUCT.md). By participating in this project you agree to abide by its terms.
